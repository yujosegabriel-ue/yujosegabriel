        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>

            I grew up in the quiet and beautiful province of Masbate, where life moved slowly and peacefully.<sup>1</sup>
            My childhood was filled with long days under the sun and the fresh smell of grass from the open fields.<sup>2</sup>
            I spent countless afternoons playing traditional Filipino games with school kids who became like siblings to me.<sup>3</sup>
            We played bente uno until our legs grew tired and our laughter echoed across the street.<sup>4</sup>
            Agawang base became our favorite pastime, especially during warm summer evenings.<sup>5</sup>
            I also collected pogs, which felt like small treasures that made my young heart excited.<sup>6</sup>
            Each new pog made me feel like I discovered gold.<sup>7</sup>
            I loved climbing trees, especially mango trees that stood tall near our house.<sup>8</sup>
            Reaching the highest branch always felt like winning a secret challenge against nature.<sup>9</sup>
            Sometimes we would sit on the branches and tell stories while feeling the wind brush against our faces.<sup>10</sup>
            Life in Masbate felt simple yet magical in its own way.<sup>11</sup>
            I never had many toys, but the outdoors became my playground.<sup>12</sup>
            I learned creativity from making games out of anything I could find.<sup>13</sup>
            My family taught me humility and kindness at a very early age.<sup>14</sup>
            They also taught me to appreciate small things in life.<sup>15</sup>
            Growing up surrounded by nature made me feel connected to the world.<sup>16</sup>
            Every day felt like a new adventure waiting for me outside our doorstep.<sup>17</sup>
            My childhood shaped who I am today in ways I will always be grateful for.<sup>18</sup>
            Those moments of innocence and fun remain some of my greatest memories.<sup>19</sup>
            Masbate will forever hold the roots of my earliest and happiest days.<sup>20</sup>
        </p>

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <div class="bio-image">

        <p>
            My high school years were a time of discovery and building new perspectives.<sup>1</sup>
            I started taking my interest in technology more seriously during this period.<sup>2</sup>
            Life in the province remained steady, but my mind was often elsewhere, dreaming of bigger things.<sup>3</sup>
            I learned the value of friendship through the bonds I formed with my classmates.<sup>4</sup>
            We spent hours talking about our futures while sitting by the bay.<sup>5</sup>
            Those years taught me how to handle the pressure of academic life.<sup>6</sup>
            I began to understand that hard work was the only way to reach my goals.<sup>7</sup>
            Every challenge I faced made me more determined to succeed.<sup>8</sup>
            I participated in school events that helped me build my confidence.<sup>9</sup>
            The simple life in Masbate provided a grounded foundation as I grew up.<sup>10</sup>
            I realized that my roots would always be a part of my identity.<sup>11</sup>
            Independence started becoming more important to me as I got older.<sup>12</sup>
            I spent my free time exploring the island’s hidden gems with my friends.<sup>13</sup>
            The sunsets in Masbate served as a daily reminder of nature's beauty.<sup>14</sup>
            I learned that patience is vital when waiting for big opportunities.<sup>15</sup>
            Family remained my strongest support system throughout these changing years.<sup>16</sup>
            I began to envision a life where I could blend my roots with modern technology.<sup>17</sup>
            Self-discipline became a habit I tried to master every single day.<sup>18</sup>
            My teenage years were the bridge between my childhood and the man I was becoming.<sup>19</sup>
            They prepared me for the bigger world that was waiting just beyond the sea.<sup>20</sup>

        <h2>College Years</h2>
        <div class="bio-image">

        <p>
            My college years at UE marked one of the most transformative stages of my life.<sup>1</sup>
            I entered school with a strong determination to build the foundation for my future career.<sup>2</sup>
            Everything felt new, exciting, and a little overwhelming at first.<sup>3</sup>
            I pushed myself academically to achieve high grades.<sup>4</sup>
            Each semester challenged me to become more disciplined.<sup>5</sup>
            I made new friends who eventually became like family.<sup>6</sup>
            We shared struggles, triumphs, and unforgettable memories.<sup>7</sup>
            Group projects taught me leadership and teamwork.<sup>8</sup>
            I joined organizations that helped me grow not only academically but socially.<sup>9</sup>
            College exposed me to real-life responsibilities that I had never experienced before.<sup>10</sup>
            One of the biggest challenges I faced was dealing with financial problems.<sup>11</sup>
            I learned how to budget every allowance and prioritize needs over wants.<sup>12</sup>
            Those struggles taught me strength and independence.<sup>13</sup>
            Despite the difficulties, I didn’t let go of my goals.<sup>14</sup>
            I studied late at night just to keep my grades up.<sup>15</sup>
            Every small achievement reminded me that hard work pays off.<sup>16</sup>
            I embraced every opportunity to improve myself.<sup>17</sup>
            College shaped me into a stronger and more resilient person.<sup>18</sup>
            It prepared me for the real world and the career path I wanted to pursue.<sup>19</sup>
            In the end, college became a journey of growth, friendship, challenges, and victories.<sup>20</sup>
